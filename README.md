Official PyTorch implementation of the paper *"Self-Supervised Relational Reasoning for Representation Learning"*.

Essential code
--------------


Here, you can find the essential code of the method with full training pipeline: 

- [single python script](./essential_script.py) self-contained script, only requires PyTorch and Torchvision.
- [jupyter notebook]() with step-by-step explanation of the algorithm.

The essential code above, trains a self-supervised relation module on CIFAR-10 with a Conv4 backbone.
